Mousing over an `Amaj7` chord symbol on Ultimate Guitar the other day, I realized that ~tens of years of guitar playing is too damn many not to know how to construct these things myself.

Wary of the deep, mind-bending [rabbit holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone) that plague Wikipedia's music theory section, I set out there to straighten out my `A7`, `Amaj7` and `Am7` once and for all.

It turns out to be no great mystery. A 7th chord is a triad + a 7th; the different flavors come from 1) changing the flavor of the base triad (major, minor, diminished), and 2) changing the flavor of the 7th note (major or minor).

Of the six chords implied by this choose-your-own-adventure, only four are apparently commonly relevant. They are, using the traditional *triad flavor*-*7th flavor* schema, the following chords.

#### Major-minor 7th, a.k.a. Dominant 7th, a.k.a. 7th

This is the bread-and-butter 7th chord. As when a chord is assumed to be major when left unspecified, the 7th is assumed to be *minor* (flatted); and so, this chord is commonly referred to as e.g. `A7`.

Why is it called the "dominant"? Apparently, in a given chord progression it's the V ("dom") chord that's traditionally made a 7th chord.

#### Minor-minor 7th, a.k.a. Minor-7th

Since we know that the 7th itself is minor by default, it makes sense that, when "minor" is specified explicitly, it's meant that the triad is minor too. So, this is nothing more than our minor triad with a minor-7th on top of it.

#### Major-major 7th, a.k.a. Major-7th

Again here, we can make an assumption: since we know that the triad is by-default major when it comes to any chord, the explicit "major" must refer to the 7th note itself. So, this chord is a major triad with a major 7th above it -- the 7th note of the major scale given by the chord's root.

#### Diminished-minor 7th, a.k.a. Diminished 7th chord

This one baffled me right off the bat. Apparently, a diminished triad is a minor triad with a flatted 5th; it's a rare bird because it's total dissonance. On top of that, you can add a minor 7th to get even more dissonance.
