It's almost time again for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) -- a festive, communal marathon that's somehow
way more fun than a LeetCode grind.

After a 14-day Haskell slog in 2018 and an 11.5-day Clojure run in 2019, I buckled down in 2020 and met my goals:
> 1. 100% the AOC in a timely manner 
> 1. Take minimal Advent-specific help from r/adventofcode or the Clojurians advent channel 
> 1. Write reasonably idiomatic Clojure code, of reasonable quality

This year my goals are the same, with the addition of a fourth:

{:start="4"}
1. Write my solutions in a "literate" or annotated format and post them as blogs

I'm unsure what exactly this will look like -- who the audience is, what kind of commentary I might add to the source code itself -- 
but I'm excited to kick-start my blog and spread some love for Clojure.

My solutions will also be available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/samharad/advent-of-code-clojure).

Comments, criticisms, ideas for improvement are welcome.
