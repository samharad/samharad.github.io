As a "ramp-up task" for blogging, I figure I'll start with a little series where I solve some LeetCode problems. Maybe I'll pick a random problem; maybe I'll start with some easies, then mediums, and then some hards; or maybe I can start with the most "popular" problems.



I could solve these problems in Clojure and then in Java, or vice versa; using IntelliJ, or using the LeetCode editor, or on paper. It will be hard to pick a language is I'm not, in fact, preparing for any particular interview.



Of course, my preference would be to solve them in Clojure; but then again, most employers would prefer to see a more conventional Java solution. For that reason, maybe it would be best to solve first in Java, and then in Clojure. This would prime me for thinking up the "optimal" imperative solutions, and then allow me to see how much more concise the Clojure implementation can be.
