This is a test post. Hello world!

```clojure
(map foo
     [1 2 3])

(->> foo
     (map bar)
     (filter baz))
```

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
